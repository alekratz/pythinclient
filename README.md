# pythinclient
A thin client interface for python

# About
Pythinclient is a library used for implementing socket-based thin clients in Python 3. It's in very early stages, but for simple applications, it should work just fine.

List of features that we need for v0.2:
* ~~Asynchronous server; one that can handle more than one client at a time~~
* More examples
* Unit tests?
